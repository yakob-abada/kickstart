# Kickstart

Kickstart is a project developed by [yakob-abada](https://github.com/yakob-abada) that serves as a starting point for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages modern web development tools and frameworks to provide a robust foundation for dApp development.

## Features

- **Ethereum Integration**: Interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts.
- **Next.js Framework**: Utilize the React-based Next.js framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript Support**: Write type-safe code with TypeScript integration.
- **Eslint Configuration**: Maintain code quality and consistency with a predefined Eslint setup.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kickstart, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yakob-abada/kickstart.git
   cd kickstart
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Copy the example environment variables file and modify it as needed:

   ```bash
   cp .env_example .env
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:

   Start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running.
